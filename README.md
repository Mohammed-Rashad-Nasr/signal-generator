# signal-generator
signal generator with operations using Matlab
 
user is allowed to specify his time range and point break points on it
then select signal type within each region 
* DC
* Ramp
* sinusoidal
* exponential
* polynomial

and enter inputs to generate the signal

after that signal will be processed by the operation user selects from
* amplitude scaling
* time shifting
* compressing
* expanding
* mirror
 
and enter inputs to generate the proccessed signal
